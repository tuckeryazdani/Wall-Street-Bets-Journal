# WSB_Journal ( Wall Street Bets Journal )

This project is fully automated in Python using various APIs to pull data, get stock market updates depending on that data, getting seasonal information on how that stock performs in the given and next season, and then posting that data to Twitter. I have updated this program to be able to then take that tweet, add it to the Twitter website HTML page in Python, and then push the changes using git in the os Python library, so that it will now show up here as well for logging purposes.
